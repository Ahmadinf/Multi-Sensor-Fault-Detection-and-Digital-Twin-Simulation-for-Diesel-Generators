# Multi-Sensor-Fault-Detection-and-Digital-Twin-Simulation-for-Diesel-Generators
A digital-twin simulator that models diesel-generator sensor signals (acoustic, vibration, temperature, oil quality, RPM) and visualizes them in time and frequency domains. It also computes pole-zero stability to produce an integrated machine-health overview.
